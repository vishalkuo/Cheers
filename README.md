# Cheers


## About
This is a machine learning program designed to make you sound fancier. 

Cheers uses a custom implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm (no libraries except numpy) to guess which region of Italy a wine might have come from based on 13 properties. To read more about the properties, check out ```Assets/wine.txt```.
